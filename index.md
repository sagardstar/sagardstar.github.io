subtitle: Economist | Novice Writer | Wannabe Singer
---

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from Brown University, where I explored development economics, particularly the intersection of gender, credit access, and policy impacts on households. Recently, I've embarked on a new adventure - crafting a newsletter to share ideas and things that spark my curiosity. When I need a break from it all, you'll find me trying my hand at singing Indian classical melodies.
